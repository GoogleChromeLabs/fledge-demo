# Advertiser

This folder represents the advertiser page. For example, this can be a Nike or Samsung website. When a user visits an advertiser page, that user can be added to an interest group by the advertiser or a DSP on behalf of the advertiser.

In this example, the advertiser page embeds the DSP code that adds the user to an interest group.
